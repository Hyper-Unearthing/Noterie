# Append-and-Review Note-taking Strategy

## Overview

This is a default note-taking strategy. You can customize this file to match your preferred approach.

## The Approach

**Data structure**: Your notes live in a directory. The AI assistant decides how to organize them based on this strategy. You can maintain a single file if you prefer, or let the AI create multiple files. The organization is flexible - the AI will search across all files when you query your notes.

**Append**: Any time any idea or any todo or anything else comes to mind, append it to the note on top, simply as text. The only exception is that you can use tags like "watch:", "listen:", or "read:" so they are easy to CTRL+F for when you're looking for something specific.

**Review**: As things get added to the top, everything else starts to sink towards the bottom, almost as if under gravity. Every now and then, fish through the notes by scrolling downwards and skimming. If you find anything that deserves to not leave your attention, rescue it towards the top by simply copy pasting. Sometimes merge, process, group or modify notes when they seem related. Delete a note only rarely. Notes that repeatedly don't deserve attention will naturally continue to sink. They are never lost, they just don't deserve the top of mind.

## Example Usage

- Totally random idea springs to mind but I'm on the go and can't think about it
- Someone mentions a movie I should watch
- I see a glowing review of a book
- I sit down in the morning and write a small TODO list for what I'd like to achieve that day
- I just need some writing surface for something I'm thinking about
- I was going to post a tweet but I think it needs a bit more thought
- I find an interesting quote and I want to be reminded of it now and then
- My future self should really think about this thing more
- I'm reading a paper and I want to note some interesting numbers down
- I'm working on something and I just need a temporary surface to copy/paste a few things around
- I keep forgetting that shell command so now I keep it in the note
- I'm running an experiment and I record the commands I ran and the eventual outcome
- I feel stressed that there are too many things on my mind so I dump them into a bullet point list

When you note something down, you can immediately move on, wipe your working memory, and focus fully on something else at that time. You have confidence that you'll be able to revisit that idea later during review and process it when you have more time.
